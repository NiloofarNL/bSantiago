# bSantiago

## Introduction

In this notebook we read and preprocess the raw data collected as a
paper-based survey conducted face-to-face in Santiago in 2016 by
Dr.Â Beatriz Mella-Lira. The survey collected information on a wide range
of travel-related issues (socio-demographics, health-related,
perceptions and travel behaviour, travel choices and planning, social
interaction factors, built environment, and so on).

The data collection considered a quota-sampling method based on the
information from the Pre-census of 2012, and with a total of 451
persons.

## Installation

You can install the development version of Santiago from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("paezha/bSantiago")
```

## Example

This example shows how to load one of the data tables included in the
package:

``` r
library(bSantiago)
data("Santiago_BE")
```

The data table `Santiago_BE` includes information about the built
environment around the place of residence of respondents:

``` r
