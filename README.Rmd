# A Reproducible Dataset to Study Transportation, Residential Context, and Well-being in Santiago, Chile in R

## Introduction

In this notebook we read and preprocess the raw data collected as a paper-based survey conducted face-to-face in Santiago in 2016 by Dr. Beatriz Mella-Lira. The survey collected information on a wide range of travel-related issues (socio-demographics, health-related, perceptions and travel behaviour, travel choices and planning, social interaction factors, built environment, and so on). 

The data collection considered a quota-sampling method based on the information from the Pre-census of 2012, and with a total of 451 persons. 


```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)
```


To access the raw material used for generating this dataset, we first need to learn how to use this repository in `RStudio`.

This project repository utilizes the {[renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/)} package to establish a reproducible environment. It is designed to facilitate work with the bSantiago dataset, titled  [A Reproducible Dataset to Study Transportation, Residential Context, and Well-being in Santiago, Chile in R]( https://github.com/paezha/bSantiago/).

The repository offers the necessary setup to recreate the environment used for generating the dataset. This encompasses the specific version of R and all the packages utilized in the dataset.

##  Instructions on using this repository

1. Begin by installing R as a programming language, ensuring that you select the appropriate version for your operating system. You can find R as a core package here: https://cran.rstudio.com/.

2. Install RStudio, again ensuring that you choose the correct version for your operating system. RStudio serves as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and can be downloaded from: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/.

3. If you're using Windows, download and run the Rtools43 installer from this link: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools43/rtools.html. For Mac users, you may need to install Xcode, though we can't verify this since we don't have access to Macs. You can find more information here: https://mac.r-project.org/tools/.

4. Download the code from the repository available at: https://github.com/paezha/bSantiago. The repository contains a `renv.lock` file specifying all package versions used in the data-set. Open the file and store it in a suitable directory.

5. Now open the `.RProj` file named "bSantiago" to launch the `R` project in RStudio.

6. Install the `renv` package by running the following command. After installation, close RStudio and restart your computer.

```
install.packages("Renv")
```

7. Double-click the bSantiago.Rproj file to relaunch RStudio. You'll receive a message in the console indicating that your library is out of sync with the lock file. Ensure both are synchronized by running the code below:

```
renv::restore()
```

If any individual library fails to install, run:

```
install.packages("name of the library")
```
replacing "name of the library" with the package name. Then run `renv::restore()` again. Repeat this process if needed.

8. Check the status of `renv` by `running renv::status()` in the R Console. The output should display a table where the second and third columns are populated with "y" characters, indicating that the versions of packages on your system match those specified by the `renv.lock` file.

9. Install `TinyTex` by running `tinytex::install_tinytex()` in the RStudio console. This command allows us to knit PDF from templates.

10. Restart R by navigating to Session -> Restart R. Then, click the green "+" button and open a new "R Markdown" file. Choose the 4th option in the left panel labeled "From Template". Select a template option from the {isdas} package, with each template representing a chapter or activity in the web-book. Provide a name for the template, such as "template-1".

Knit the "template-1.Rmd" to a .pdf file by clicking the arrow on the "Knit" button and selecting "PDF".

Congratulations! You've successfully knitted your first PDF file.

## Working with bSantiago data set

Now here is the instructions on how to use raw material to generate all the necessary information based on the research objectives. After opening a new R Markdown file you can go through the following steps: 

### bSantiago Installation

You can install the development version of Santiago from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` 
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("paezha/bSantiago")
```


### How to regenerate bSantiago data-set

Here is a flowchart starting from raw data to ready for analysis data-set:
