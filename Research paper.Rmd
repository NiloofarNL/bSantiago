#A Dataset to Study Transportation, Residential Context, and Well-being in Santiago, Chile

##Abstract

Nowadays commuting as a daily travel mostly between work and home is considered as an inevitable part of modern lifestyle. Understanding commuting patterns and travel behavior is important for analyzing stress-related issues, consequences and coping strategies. This dataset is part of a thesis aiming to identify how motorized and non-motorized commuters interact with experiencing stress during their travels. The dataset is based on a paper-based survey conducted face-to-face during November and December 2016 in Santiago, Chile in 2016. A large body of data has made inroads investigating the psychological impact on travellers ranging from positive feelings of enjoyment in some to the sensation of stress in many others that can affect the effectiveness of policy measures and are known to affect health outcomes. The data set contributes to the psychological impact on travellers on both active and motorized modes of transportation to examine not only the feeling of stress but also how these effects are experienced by travellers and investigate the importance that travellers attach to their feelings of stress which makes it valuable for researchers who focused on public sector development and health-related policies. Furthermore, the dataset lies in its potential contributions to transportation policies, public sector development, and health-related policies, as it addresses commuting stress and diverse travel-related issues, encouraging further exploration and fostering reproducibility through transparent methodologies, comprehensive documentation, and open data practices, thereby laying a foundation for future research.

                  
## Introduction

Understanding the multi-dimensional nature of urban living in Santiago is crucial for effective planning and policymaking.
 	As @gainza2013urban have mentioned that travel has influenced the urban form of Santiago as the city spreads out because of the monocentric nature of that. In terms of urban development and sprawling land uses, Hall, @hall1994transportation indicated that Santiago has experienced highly deregulated urban growth on the urban periphery at the expense of the conventional business district and more central comunas. Furthermore, 
@basso2020accessibility focused on public transport accessibility and its role in mitigating inequalities across Santiago. Living and traveling in Santiago can be influenced by social exclusion and income level as @ureta2008move analyzed the mobility patterns of low-income people in everyday life and their situation of social exclusion.
 	
As @graells2016sensing mentioned, urban policy takes several inputs into account. Travel surveys are one of them, because they provide rich information about the city: where people travel to (and from), the purpose of the trip (e.g., commuting to work), the mode (e.g., metro), the time spent traveling, as well as other socio-demographic variables. Large-scale travel surveys are invaluable sources of information to understand travel behaviour and other aspects of the urban experience, such as the residential context. By their nature, they often shy away from overloading respondents with additional questions.

This paper introduces a comprehensive dataset derived from a meticulously designed survey that captures various aspects of the experience of living and moving in a major city in the Global South. The dataset includes self- assessed health questions, respondentsâ€™ feelings and emotions during commuting experience, characteristics of the built environment, individual demographics, commuting behaviors, the social experience of a variety of transportation modes, and patterns of use of information and telecommunication technologies. Moreover, it encompasses respondents' attitudes towards the effectiveness of the local transportation system, as well as their perceptions of the city's sustainability and natural environment.

The combination of all these aspects makes this data set a novel, multifaceted and significant as it allows for a holistic analysis of how different modes of transportation influence daily life and individual well-being in an urban setting. By integrating traditional urban study variables with emerging factors like technology use and environmental attitudes, this dataset provides a unique lens through which the urban experience in Santiago can be understood. Furthermore, the inclusion of geographical variables offers critical insights into the spatial patterns of urban living, highlighting how location influences lifestyle and transportation choices in Santiago.

## Data Collection, Materials and Methods

## How does data preprocessing contribute to reproducibility?
As mentioned earlier, the current study is based on a survey. In the data preprocessing step we went through addressing some issues such as splitting multiple answers in a single cell of the survey. Having the answers separated into distinct columns, allows future researchers to gain flexibility in analyzing the data and generating tables tailored to their research questions or goals. The specific analyses and tables created will depend on the nature of the data and the research objectives.

When starting from scratch after splitting and reshaping the data, researchers can use various techniques for a more granular analysis of individual responses and choosing the specific answer among multiple ones in a single cell.

One idea is using frequency tables as they can observe the occurrences of each response for each split variable useful in understanding the distribution of the response.

The second approach way is to take advantage of cross-tabulations for split variables against each other, as it gives insights into relationships and patterns in the data.

Also calculating summary statistics for each split variable allows us to understand central tendency and variability. There are many other ways, such as visualization, comparisons, tests, and data exploration, to specify the appropriate answer out of multiple ones.

When starting from the raw data and following the same preprocessing and analysis steps, researchers could generally end up with similar tables and results. However, several factors can influence whether the results are exactly the same such as differences in data cleaning and handling missing data, parameters or thresholds according to the analysis, and random sampling (if applicable).

In summary, while exact replication is not always guaranteed, careful documentation, consistency in preprocessing, and transparent reporting of analysis steps contribute to the reproducibility of results. Additionally, using the bSantiago GitHub repository and shared codes can facilitate collaboration and make it easier for future researchers to reproduce the results.

## Brief overview of the tables in the data Package

The dataset contains multiple tables, each focusing on different aspects of transportation, residential context, and well-being of urban residents in Santiago. Below is a summarized overview of these tables:

Santiago_IC (Individual Characteristics):
This section includes a wide range of socio-economic and demographic attributes such as age, gender, education, occupation, and household context.

Santiago_TW (Commuting Behavior):
Commuting behavior and job-related variables including job accessibility, job satisfaction, commute duration, and transportation expenditure can be found in this section.
In terms of the level of satisfaction with their current job, statistics shows that almost 60% of respondents are at least highly satisfied. We also see that long commutes are frequent in this sample, with about one-third of respondents spending 1 h or more travelling and about one-quarter of respondents spending between 40 minutes and one hour in their daily commute. This distribution is noteworthy because time spent commuting has been recognized as a factor that can affect physical and mental health and well-being in particular in association with motorized transportation [@brutus2017cycling].


Santiago_SI (Social Interaction): 
This section is focused on social interaction variables such as: levels of social interaction and discrimination experienced during commuting, including interaction levels and discrimination by mode of transport. 

Social interaction is a topic of interest for mode-related choices given earlier evidence that for some commuters privacy is an important consideration and/or a way to manage social stressors [@paez2010enjoyment]; [@lowe2016conceptual]; [@gardner2007drives].

Santiago_IS (Information and Telecommunication, Mode Shifting): 
Variables related to use of technology for travel information, quality of mode shifts, waiting times, travel times, and difficulty in mode changing can be found in this section.

Santiago_BE (Built Environment):
Perceptions and importance of built environment attributes such as space for autos, parking, highways, pedestrian space, and cleanliness of bus stops are included in Santiago_BE section.

Santiago_H (Health):
Health-related information including stress, physical effort, proximity to other travelers, environmental pollution, safety, and comfort during commutes have been stored in health section.

Santiago_FE (Feelings and Emotions):
Emotional responses and feelings associated with different modes of transportation, including freedom, safety, luxury, environmental care, and social interaction can be found in feeling and emotions section.

Santiago_RPD (Decision-making and Planning):
Variables related to decision-making and planning, are namely as:  accessibility to employment, social and recreational activities, importance of transportation options, and quality of public transport.

Santiago_NS (Nature and Sustainability): 
Perspectives on sustainable transportation, willingness to pay for sustainable modes, and the importance of environmental attributes like trees and parks are grouped as nature and sustainability section.

comuna_1 (Geographical Variables):
Geographical information related to the respondentsâ€™ location, including commune and macro zone identifiers, providing region-specific insights can be found in comuna section.

Each table is linked by a common unique identifier (ID), allowing for multi-theme analysis of the data. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of how transportation and built environment influence daily life and well-being in Santiago.



## Discussion and Conclusion

This not only aids in reproducibility by offering a high-level overview of the datasetâ€™s characteristics but also assists researchers in quickly understanding the pertinent details of the dataset.

The data collection process, employing a quota-sampling method, is crucial for the dataset's reproducibility. The detailed explanation of how the sample was obtained allows future researchers to understand the representativeness of the dataset in relation to the population of Santiago in 2016. This level of transparency makes it feasible to replicate the sampling method in future studies or to compare it with alternative strategies, thus contributing to the reproducibility of the research.

Additionally, the thorough description of the paper-based survey, including its content focusing on areas such as demographics, health, and emotional states, enhances the ability to reproduce the study. Researchers aiming to replicate or extend this work can gain valuable insights into the survey structure, question types, and the scope of topics covered, ensuring that future studies can align with or build upon the original research framework. 
The data cleaning and preprocessing steps are meticulously documented, including the tools and packages used, such as the dplyr package in R. This documentation provides a clear roadmap for future researchers, ensuring that the processed dataset meets the quality standards intended by the original researchers. Moreover, the use of a Quarto Markdown file for data documentation helps in providing a clear and concise reference for understanding the datasetâ€™s structure and content, including informative tables and graphs generated with various R packages.
Making the dataset publicly available on a dedicated GitHub repository enhances reproducibility by fostering transparency and openness. The use of version control with Git ensures that any changes to the dataset are meticulously tracked over time, allowing for a clear understanding of its evolution and facilitating reproducibility in subsequent analyses.

In summary, the Santiago dataset is not just a collection of data but a well-documented and robustly managed resource that encourages reproducibility through transparent methodologies, comprehensive documentation, and open data practices. This approach not only secures the reliability of the current study but also sets a strong foundation for future research endeavors and collaborations within the scientific community.
